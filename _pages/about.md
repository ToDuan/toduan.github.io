# 👨🏼‍🎓 About Me
I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in the [Ministry of Education Key Lab for Intelligent Networks and Network Security](https://nskeylab.xjtu.edu.cn/site/lab/),
Xi'an Jiaotong University, advised by [Assoc. Prof. Junzhou Zhao](https://junzhouzhao.github.io/) and [Prof. Pinghui Wang](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/phwang). 
Before that, I received my M.Eng. degree and B.Eng. degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University and Harbin Engineering University, respectively.
My research interests focus on *network security and privacy*, *network traffic analysis*, *streaming data mining*, and *AIOps*.
